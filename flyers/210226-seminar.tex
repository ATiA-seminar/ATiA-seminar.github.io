\begin{abstract}
It is well-known that persistence diagrams can be obtained from the rank function via M\"{o}bius inversion. 
In the case of the graded rank function introduced by Betthauser, Bubenik, and Edwards, M\"{o}bius inversion gives rise to sets of ordered pairs which may have negative multiplicities. 
We call these virtual persistence diagrams. 
We show that the 1-Wasserstein distance extends to virtual persistence diagrams in a natural way. 
We also consider the measure-theoretic analog of signed measures and distances between them. 
Motivated by the work of Divol and Lacombe, we set up a framework for discussing the (signed) Wasserstein distances for persistence diagrams and measures defined on arbitrary pairs of metric spaces. 

\emph{N.B.This is joint work with Peter Bubenik.}
