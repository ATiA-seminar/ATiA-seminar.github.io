\begin{abstract}
Links of strata in singular spaces are fundamental invariants which govern the topology of small neighbourhoods around points in those strata. This talk will focus on inferring links of strata from incomplete information in three completely different contexts. In each case, there are exciting consequences of learning the structure of such links.
