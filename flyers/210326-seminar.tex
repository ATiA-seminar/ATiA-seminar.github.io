\begin{abstract}
Motivated both by theoretical and practical considerations in topological data analysis, we generalize the $p$-Wasserstein distance on barcodes to multi-parameter persistence modules.  For each $p\in [1,\infty]$, we in fact introduce two such generalizations $d_{\mathcal I}^p$ and $d_{\mathcal M}^p$, such that $d_{\mathcal I}^\infty$ equals the interleaving distance and $d_{\mathcal M}^\infty$ equals the matching distance.  These distances turn out to have several good properties.  We use them to study the continuity of (2-parameter) multicover persistent homology, revealing nuances to the stability theory for multicover persistence which are not seen by the interleaving distance.  This is joint work with Michael Lesnick.
